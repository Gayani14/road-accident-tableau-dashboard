This project is designed to visualize and analyze road accident data through a comprehensive Tableau dashboard. The goal is to provide users with insights into road safety, identify patterns, and help inform decision-making processes for improving traffic safety measures.

### Key Features:
- Interactive Maps: Visualize accident hotspots and geographic trends to identify high-risk areas.
- Trend Analysis: Explore accident trends over time, broken down by month, day, and time of day to understand peak accident periods.
- Accident Breakdown: Analyze the types of accidents (e.g., collisions, rollovers) and their severity levels, providing clarity on common causes and outcomes.
- Comparative Insights: Compare data across different regions or timeframes to assess the effectiveness of road safety initiatives and policies.
- I have used parameters,groups and calculated fields to create year on year (YoY) accident and casuality details.

### Data Source:
This dashboard utilizes publicly available road accident data from KAGGLE, ensuring a comprehensive analysis based on real-world incidents.
